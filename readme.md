Charity application

The goal of the project is to create place where the user can donate unnecessary things to a charitable foundation.

To run the application on your own device, you need to add a new database named charity_donation and configure the connection.
The next step is to add the JVM parameter:
name - jasypt.encryptor.password
value - charity
or changing the email and password to your own in the file application.properties.

Super admin login details:
mail - admin@mail.com
password - super
